This is a simple C# application written using "OOP" principles. Programs front-end is written using WPF/Xaml 
as well as .Json database files. I tried to implement the logic of two-synchronized databases which would connect 
the appointments of pacients and doctors through the appointments. User authorization and database generator 
are provided.
